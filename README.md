***Features:***
* adds a digital camera to the UC2 System
* enables sharing your results easily



## In-Action

By adding a microscope objective lens, a folding mirror and a torch, a simple compound microscope can be created:

# Software

The source code for the camera can be found here: https://github.com/beniroquai/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3-Sense-camera

The online flashing tool to flash the software can be found here: https://matchboxscope.github.io/firmware/FLASH.html

Additional information about the camera module can be found here: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started

# Hardware

Below we describe how the device can be build and assembled in order to replicate the whole system as shown in the rendering above. One needs additional parts that can be found in the core [openUC2 repository](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT).

## Bill of material

Below you will find all components necessary to build this device

### 3D printing files

All these files need to be printed. We used a Prusa i3 MK3 using PLA Prusament (Galaxy Black) at layer height 0.3 mm and infill 20%.


|  Type | Details  |  Price | Link  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base | Base Holder for the camera |  1,00 € | [Part.stl](./STL/)  |
| Plate | Base Plate for the camera |  1,00 € | [Part.stl](./STL/)  |


### Additional parts

This is used in the current version of the setup

|  Type | Details  |  Price | Link  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Xiao Sense | Represents the digital camera |  15 € | [Xiao]()  |
| Screw | Din912 |  1 € | [Xiao]()  |
